# -Prediction-of-Autism-risk-genes-associated-with-long-non-coding-RNA
This project aims to classify autism-related risk genes by leveraging machine learning algorithms on features derived from long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) data. Identifying these risk genes can contribute to understanding the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
